Disclaimer:
I was not planning on releasing anymore mods until someone released another one. I was the first to make the infinite capacity, infinite name length, and limits removed mods so I kinda felt odd when everyone else was doing the same and even releasing them. Even when I said not to release anything overpowered, someone still did so {I'm not naming anyone}. I'm unsure why, but I don't hold it against them, for the game is already dead. Since the game died, I figured "why don't I Just release a few more mods to show them why I was nicknamed King of DevX?"
